# I feel

Analysis of how Reddit feels.

:construction: Repo is in progress! :construction:

## Data dump

Data publicly available [here](https://osf.io/zbfmg/)

## Scratch

- how does reddit feel in general? (need to label feelings somehow)
- can we see any changes in feelings over time (e.g. the_donald)
- can we predict the subreddit based on the feeling?
- are any subreddits overly negative or positive?
